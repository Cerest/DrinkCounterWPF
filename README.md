# DrinkCounterWPF

**Features:**

-Set a drinking limit per evening. Default is 3 but can be customized on the text file.Hands-free age verification. 
-There's 0 contact with an individual's card, which is important in the post-COVID world. Default age requirement is 21 but can be customized. This customization is useful if you wanted to repurpose this application for another event (for example lowering the age limit would help you keep track of rations after a natural disaster).
-Reset time. Data is wiped clean after a certain amount of time. Default is 12 hours but can be customized.
-PII obfuscation, only hashed DoDIDs are stored and no other piece of PII. This reduces the amount of security needed to maintain the application and is thus easier to manage as just DoDID is very low risk.
